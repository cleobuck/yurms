To get acquainted with a front-end framework I had to design a restaurant website using bootstrap. I chose insect cuisine as I like to keep things interesting and original.  Here's how it turned out:

# Epiphany

I have to be honest; I really despise bootstrap. It is as rigid as old-school mother-in-law and it is not efficient when it comes to unused CSS. I feel like I spend more time trying to work around its basic structure to override exisiting classes'properties than if I had designed it from scratch. In the future, I will get familiar with tailwind CSS, which is a framework with much more flexibility. 


# Design from mistakes

As I was playing around with the design, I saw the background spider come to life (you will notice it as you travel from one page to the other). I decided to keep this effect. If it were a real restaurant, it might be a good idea to skip that part, as a live spiders might not be the most appetizing idea. 

# Reponsiveness 

I found bootstrap useful to make the website fully responsive quickly. However, this can also easily be done with flexbox and css grid.
